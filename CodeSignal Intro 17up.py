"""

You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

Example

For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
arrayChange(inputArray) = 3.

    #If x[i] < x[i+1], pass.
    #Else, find the difference x[i]+1-x[i+1].  Add this 
    #difference to total and then set x[i+1] to x[i]+1

"""Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabb", the output should be

We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.
